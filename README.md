# Adventure Engine
A CLI tool to create and play your own text adventures.

## Installation
You can install Adventure Engine via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), you just have to add my tap:
```
% brew tap essay97/harrysthings
% brew update
% brew install adventure-engine
```
## Usage
If you want to play around a bit with a built-in adventure (everything is a mess for now, it just works), type `adventure default`.  
For more specific instructions, type `adventure help`.
